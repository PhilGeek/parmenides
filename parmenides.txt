First Deduction

137C 		H1 If the one is, it is not many
137C–D 		The one is not a whole of parts
137D 		The one having no parts is without limit
137D–138A 	The one having no limits is without shape
138A–B		The one is nowhere being neither in itself or another
138B–139B	The one is neither in motion nor at rest
139B–E		The one is not the same nor different form itself or another
140B–D		The one is not equal or unequal to itself or another
140E–141D 	The one cannot be or become older or younger than, or the same age as, itself or 			another or be in time
141D–142A	Since it is not in time, the one in no sense is, and cannot be named or known

Second Deduction

142B–C		H2 If the one is, it is one being with unity and being
142C–D		The one being is a whole of parts
142D–145A	The one being has limits and is indefinitely numerous
145A–B		The one being can have shape
145B–E		The one being can be in itself and another
145E–146A	The one being can be in motion and at rest
146A–147B	The one being is the same as, and different from, itself and the others
147C–148D	The one being is like and unlike itself and the others
148D–149D	The one being is, and is not, in contact with itself and the others
149D–151B	The one being is equal and unequal both to itself and to others
151B–E		The one being is equal and unequal to both itself and the others
155C–E		The one being is, can be named and known.

155E–156B	H2A The one being comes into being and ceases to exist, is combined and separated, 			becomes like and unlike, increases and diminishes
156C–157B	The transition in becoming and change is instantaneous
